## Hello, I'm Egor! Full Stack developer.
### About me
Completed degree in mechanical engineering and automation, but decided to switch to IT. Did extensive elective coursework in computer science and programming.
Full Stack development turned out to be quite a fun domain, which I currently study and work on daily. **Here are the technologies and languages I use:**
#### Frontend design & programming

#### How I learned to program
• I started programming in 2017 in Pascal to pass high school exams in ICT in 2018. 
<br/>
• In the berinning of 2019 I came across a book "Jumping into C++" by Alex Allain, which got me to OOP, debugging, namespaces, STL by the end of 2019.
<br/>
• In 2020 read a book on algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava "Grokking algorithms", which gave me a great insight of recursion, data structures, efficiency, dynamic programming, and, of course, algorithms.
<br/>
• During pandemic 2020 I had been freelancing on freelancehunt.com to sustain myself for about 6 months. Later I started studying React and Redux up until now.
<br/>
• Of course, I didn't just read books, but hundreds of hours of tutorials, implementations of different projects, some of which can be found in my repos, online courses and technical interviews - all these factors contributed to my current set of skills and knowledge. This is a story of my programming experience, there was a lot going on alongside with that, work experience can be found on my LinkedIn, relevant courses on my website, the link is in my profile section.
