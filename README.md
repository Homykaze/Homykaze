## Hello, I'm Egor! Full Stack developer.
### About me
Completed degree in mechanical engineering and automation, but decided to switch to IT. Did extensive elective coursework in computer science and programming.
Full Stack development turned out to be quite a fun domain, which I currently study and work on daily. Here are the technologies and languages I use.

### How did I learn to program
I started programming in 2017 in Pascal to pass high school exams in ICT. Using this language was entertaining enough to give me a great impression of what programming is.Anyway, I wasn't sure of what I wanted to study and got into LAB Univerity of Applied Sciences studying mechanical engineering and automation. I quickly realized that math and physics wasn't exactly what was driving me to study on, but programming was, even though I respect all of them equally.
<br/>
<br/>
In 2018 I came across a book "Jumping into C++" by Alex Allain, which became the most sacred source of programming materials for me. Still focusing on my degree studies and working a lot at home slowed everything down, but I got into OOP, debugging, namespaces, STL by the end of 2019.
Right after that I also read a book on algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava "Grokking algorithms", which gave me a great insight of recursion, data structures, efficiency, dynamic programming, and, of course, algorithms.
<br/>
<br/>
During pandemic 2020 I started freelancing on freelancehunt.com to sustain myself doing simple projects in C++. I also found that web development was in demand, which I quickly learned to do having watched dozens of hours of tutorials online on HTML, CSS, and JS. I managed to implement a few projects in web development, which grasped my attention to web development. I made my first webpage page in the beginning of 2021, with an interactive JavaScript application. Later I started studying React and Redux up until now.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I didn't just read books, hundreds of hours of tutorials, implementations of different projects, some of which can be found in my repos, online courses and technical interviews - all these factors contributed to my current set of skills and knowledge. This is a story of my programming experience, there was a lot going on alongside with that, work experience can be found on my LinkedIn, relevant courses on my website, the link is in my profile section.
